<p>#A</p>

<p>Accounting Equation</p>

<p>Accounting equation describes that the total value of assets of a business is always equal to its liabilities plus owner&rsquo;s equity. This equation is the foundation of modern double entry system of accounting being used by small proprietors to large multinational corporations. Other names used for accounting equation are balance sheet equation and fundamental or basic accounting equation.The claims to the assets owned by a business entity are primarily divided into two types &ndash; the claims of creditors and the claims of owner of the business. In accounting, the claims of creditors are referred to as liabilities and the claims of owner are referred to as owner&rsquo;s equity. Accounting equation is simply an expression of the relationship among assets, liabilities and owner&rsquo;s equity in a business. The general form of this equation is given below:</p>

<p>Assets = Liabilities + Owner&rsquo;s Equity</p>

<p>Accounting Rate of Return</p>

<p>The accounting rate of return (ARR), also called the simple or average rate of return, is an investment formula used to measure the annual earnings or profit an investment is expected to make. In other words, it calculates how much money or return you as an investor will make on your investment.</p>

<p>Accounting Rate of Return = Investment Income / Cost of Investment</p>

<p>Accrual Accounting</p>

<p>When transactions are recorded in the books of accounts as they occur even if the payment for that particular product or service has not been received or made, it is known as accrual based accounting. This method is more appropriate in assessing the health of the organisation in financial terms.</p>

<p>Accrertion</p>

<p>Accretion is the gradual and incremental growth of assets and earnings due to business expansion, a company&rsquo;s internal growth, or a merger or acquisition. In finance, accretion is also the accumulation of the additional income an investor expects to receive after purchasing a bond at a discount and holding it until maturity. The most well-known applications of financial accretion include zero-coupon bonds or cumulative preferred stock.</p>

<p>Ad Valorem Tax</p>

<p>Governments at every level levy a variety of taxes to generate revenue. They also use a multitude of methods to calculate these taxes. One of the means that taxing authorities use is to base the tax on the value of an item. These taxes are known as &ldquo;ad valorem&rdquo; taxes, which comes from the Latin words meaning &ldquo;according to the value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adhesion Contract</p>

<p>A contract of adhesion refers to a contract drafted by one party in a position of power, leaving the weaker party to &ldquo;take it or leave it.&rdquo; Adhesion contracts are generally created by businesses providing goods or services in which the customer must either sign the boilerplate contract or seek services elsewhere. To explore this concept, consider the following adhesion contract definition.</p>

<p>Affiliate</p>

<p>An affiliate, in general business terms, is an &ldquo;official attachment&rdquo; of one business entity to another. Official attachment implies a contract or agreement of some kind and an announcement to the public of the connection between the two businesses. Whether one business is an affiliate of another is based on common ownership, common management, and the existence of a contract.</p>

<p>Affiliate Marketing</p>

<p>Affiliate marketing is an online sales tactic that lets a product owner increase sales by allowing others targeting the same audience&mdash;&ldquo;affiliates&rdquo;&mdash;to earn a commission by recommending the product to others. At the same time, it makes it possible for affiliates to earn money on product sales without creating products of their own.</p>

<p>Allocational Efficiency</p>

<p>Allocational efficiency, also known as allocative efficiency, is a characteristic of an efficient market where capital is assigned in a way that is most beneficial to the parties involved.</p>

<p>Amalgamation</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;amalgamation&rdquo; refers to the process of combining two or more entities to form a new entity, in which neither of the two combining entities survive as a legal entity and instead end up forming a completely new entity that houses the combined assets and liabilities of all the combining entities. However, it is to be noted that the term amalgamation and merger are used interchangeably in certain counties.</p>

<p>Annuitant</p>

<p>An annuitant is a person who is entitled to the income benefits from an annuity. This is also the person whose life expectancy determines the payment amounts. The annuitant is usually the annuity contract owner but can also be the spouse or a friend or relative of the annuity owner. A company or other such entity cannot be an annuitant.</p>

<p>Annualization</p>

<p>To annualize a number means to convert a short-term calculation or rate into an annual rate. Typically, an investment that yields a short-term rate of return is annualized to determine an annual rate of return, which may also include compounding or reinvestment of interest and dividends. It helps to annualize a rate of return to better compare the performance of one security versus another.</p>

<p>Annuitization</p>

<p>An annuitant is a person who is entitled to the income benefits from an annuity. This is also the person whose life expectancy determines the payment amounts. The annuitant is usually the annuity contract owner but can also be the spouse or a friend or relative of the annuity owner. A company or other such entity cannot be an annuitant.</p>

<p>Annuity</p>

<p>An annuity is a series of equal payments made at equal intervals during a period of time. In other words, it&rsquo;s a system of making or receiving payments where the payment amount and time period between payments is equal.</p>

<p>Anomaly</p>

<p>In economics and finance, an anomaly is when the actual result under a given set of assumptions is different from the expected result predicted by a model. An anomaly provides evidence that a given assumption or model does not hold up in practice. The model can either be a relatively new or older model.</p>

<p>Anticipatory Breach</p>

<p>An anticipatory breach is when a contract is not fulfilled, and an entitlement to legal remedy occurs. Repudiation occurs when the promisor refuses, or explicitly states, that they will not honor their contractual obligations before the predetermined contractual end date. It can be exercised when the promisee provided consideration in terms of payment, and the promisor party failed to perform contractual obligations.</p>

<p>Autarky</p>

<p>Autarky is the term used to describe a country or economy that operates independently. Autarky, in its most basic sense, means &ldquo;self-sufficient,&rdquo; though it&rsquo;s almost always used in correlation with a political or economic system, meaning that the entity &ndash; whatever it is &ndash; can operate and exist free of outside influence, support, or trade. #B</p>

<p>Back-End Ratio</p>

<p>The back-end ratio is a way to evaluate a borrower&rsquo;s credit risk. Many lenders use the ratio instead of or in conjunction with the front-end ratio, which also evaluates a borrower&rsquo;s financial obligations in relation to his or her income (but is less conservative than the back-end ratio). Many lenders have a rule of thumb that a borrower&rsquo;s back-end ratio should not exceed 36%, though a borrower with good credit puts lenders a bit more at ease in special cases.</p>

<p>Back-To-Back Letters Of Credit</p>

<p>A letter of credit is often written by a bank or an institutional intermediary promising that it will be responsible for a holder&rsquo;s payment to a beneficiary if the holder does not make the payment. A back-to-back letter of credit is used when an intermediary is involved in a financial transaction between a buyer and a seller. A broker or a financial institution can act as an intermediary between the buyer and seller. In such case, one letter of credit is issued to the intermediary. Two letters of credit (LCs) are involved in a back-to-back letter of credit transaction.The intermediary then secures a second letter of credit to complete the transaction.</p>

<p>Blackflush Costing</p>

<p>Backflush costing is a delayed accounting process used in Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory system where the cost of producing goods and services like raw material cost, labour cost and various other direct, indirect cost, overheads are determined, calculated and recorded only after they have been produced, completed or sold by using a standard cost per unit multiplied by the quantity of goods produced.</p>

<p>Backtesting</p>

<p>Backtesting is the process of applying a trading strategy or analytical method to historical data to see how accurately the strategy or method would have predicted actual results. Backtesting offers analysts, traders, and investors a way to evaluate and optimize their trading strategies and analytical models before implementing them. The notion is that a strategy that would have worked poorly in the past will probably work poorly in the future, and vice versa. But as you can see, a key part of backtesting is the risky assumption that past performance predicts future performance.</p>

<p>Bad Credit</p>

<p>A person with bad credit is considered a risky borrower, usually due to owing large amounts of money or having a history of unpaid bills and debts. Having bad credit can make it hard to get a credit card, mortgage, or other loans. Bad credit is usually seen as a credit score under 580.</p>

<p>Bad Debt</p>

<p>Bad debt is an expense that a business incurs once the repayment of credit previously extended to a customer is estimated to be uncollectible. Bad debt is a contingency that must be accounted for by all businesses who extend credit to customers, as there is always a risk that payment will not be received.</p>

<p>Bad Debt Expense</p>

<p>Bad debts expense is related to a company&rsquo;s current asset accounts receivable. Bad debts expense is also referred to as uncollectible accounts expense or doubtful accounts expense. Bad debts expense results because a company delivered goods or services on credit and the customer did not pay the amount owed.</p>

<p>Bag Holder</p>

<p>A bag holder is an informal term used to describe an investor who holds a position in a security that decreases in value until it descends into worthlessness. In most cases, the bag holder stubbornly retains their holdings for an extended period, during which time, the value of the investment goes to zero.</p>

<p>Balance of Payments</p>

<p>The Balance of Payments is a statement that contains the transactions made by residents of a particular country with the rest of the world over a specific time period. It is also known as the balance of international payments and if often abbreviated as BOP. It summarizes all payments and receipts by firms, individuals, and the government. The transactions can be both factor payments and transfer payments.</p>

<p>Balance of Trade</p>

<p>The balance of trade (BOT) is defined as the country&rsquo;s exports minus its imports. For any economy current asset, BOT is one of the significant components as it measures a country&rsquo;s net income earned on global assets. The current account also takes into account all payments across country borders. In general, the trade balance is an easy way to measure as all goods and services must pass through the customs office and are thus recorded.</p>

<p>Balance of Trade formula = Country&rsquo;s Exports &ndash; Country&rsquo;s Imports</p>

<p>Balanced Fund</p>

<p>A balanced fund is a type of hybrid mutual fund, meaning that the fund contains a diversified portfolio of more than one type of asset. In the case of a balanced fund, these mixed assets include stocks and bonds (and sometimes money markets). The term &ldquo;balance&rdquo; comes into play due to the fund&rsquo;s asset mix, which remains relatively static. The typical mix is composed of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. This balanced portfolio provides the investor with a safety net if the market should experience a downturn. Sometimes a balanced fund is also called an asset allocation fund. A balanced fund is best-suited to investors who are looking to take advantage of the market when it is performing well, while still having significant protection from an economic downturn. They are a great fit for retirees and more passive investors. Both of these types of investors benefit from the safety and low-to-medium-risk diversification that a balanced fund has to offer.</p>

<p>Bancassurance</p>

<p>Bancassurance is the combination of bank and Life Assurance Company. It is a partnership between bank and Assurance Company to sell products like life assurance, and other insurance products to a bank&rsquo;s client, they also offer insurance benefits to the bank&rsquo;s customers and by doing this both companies earn a profit. Bancassurance is nothing but selling life insurance products via banks. Banks and life insurance companies come together to do business in partnership. It is useful for both the banks and insurance companies because here, the bank sells the product of insurance companies to their clients, and the bank also offers bank products to those insurance clients. Insurance company offers a policy to the client in which customers have to pay premium payments every year, and insurance companies will give you a lump-sum payment, which is known as a death benefit. It is one of the securities in which the owner buys this product as security. If any accidental death happens in the future, then this product will help the owner&rsquo;s family because the family gets lump-sum cash.</p>

<p>Bandwagon Effect</p>

<p>The bandwagon effect is the tendency of people to take certain actions or arrive at a conclusion primarily because other people are doing so. The phenomenon is observed in various fields, such as economics, politics, and psychology. Financial markets are no different. It is important to understand how the bandwagon effect is described in economics because it illustrates the magnitude of the effect. Gary Becker, a well-known economist from the University of Chicago, purported that the bandwagon effect is powerful enough to flip the demand curve to be upward sloping. A typical demand curve is downward sloping, which means as prices rise, the demand falls. However, as Becker posits, an upward sloping would imply that even as prices rise, the demand rises.</p>

<p>Basel I</p>

<p>Basel I, also known as 1988 Basel accord, are the standard sets of banking regulations on minimum capital requirement for banks that is based on certain percentages of risk-weighted assets with the goal to minimize credit risk. The banks which operate internationally are required to maintain a minimum capital of 8% on the basis of risk-weighted assets. So far, three sets of regulations have been formed, of which Basel I is the first one, and together all of them are called Basel accords. These norms set help in building confidence among international investors, customers, government, and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>Basel II</p>

<p>Basel II is the second set of regulations on Minimum Capital Requirement, Supervisory Review, and Role and Market discipline and disclosure and were created for International Banks by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision in order to maintain a transparent and risk-free banking environment. The banking system depends totally on trust. Investors can only gain trust when they know that their money is secured. Basel II norms are designed in such a way that there are regulations that prevent banks to take risk on their own and don&rsquo;t respect depositor&rsquo;s money. The business model of any bank is to accept deposits in the form of savings or fixed deposits and to use this capital to issue loans to individuals or businesses. So the main focus of regulators should be to check how much is the inflow vs the outflow of capital. Basel 2 norms focus on the minimum capital requirement of the banks as well as on other areas.</p>

<p>Basel III</p>

<p>Basel III is a regulatory framework, an extension in the Basel Accords, designed and agreed upon by the members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to strengthen the capital requirements of banks and mitigate risk. This is done by requiring the banks to hold more capital reserves against their assets which would in turn reduce the capacity of banks to get leverage. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was established in 1974 with the aim to ensure financial stability by making stringent regulations on banking practices and finances. The committee comprised of governors from central banks of ten different countries &ndash; headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. The Basel committee initially consisted of the G10 members. Later in 2009, it expanded the membership to institutions from Brazil, Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Japan, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, Canada, Belgium, Indonesia, Switzerland, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, all of which form.</p>

<p>Basket Trade</p>

<p>A basket trade is an order type where you purchase or sell a group of securities. Basket trading allows you to pinpoint a specific sector, or a type of stock like higher dividend payers, that you believe will outperform.You can also target asset classes other than stocks, including currencies, commodities, and bonds. There are several benefits to purchasing baskets of shares. This includes diversification which reduces the volatility of purchasing individual shares.Basket trading is practiced by institutional investors and hedge funds, but can also be utilized by retail traders.</p>

<p>Blockchain</p>

<p>Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.</p>

<p>Brand</p>

<p>A brand is a name given to a product and/or service such that it takes on an identity by itself.In today&rsquo;s marketplace teeming with thousands of products and services, all of which are being rapidly commoditized, a brand stands out from the clutter and attracts attention. A brand name can create and stand for loyalty, trust, faith, premium ness or mass-market appeal, depending on how the brand is marketed, advertised and promoted.</p>

<p>Brand Awareness</p>

<p>Brand awareness is a measure of how familiar a customer is with a brand. The greater the brand awareness a business enjoys, the more their products and services are recognizable to their target audience, thus, in theory, augmenting its long-term strength on the marketplace. Brand awareness is a key element of an effective marketing strategy.</p>

<p>Brand Equity</p>

<p>Brand equity is a marketing term that describes a brand&rsquo;s value. That value is determined by consumer perception of and experiences with the brand. If people think highly of a brand, it has positive brand equity. When a brand consistently under-delivers and disappoints to the point where people recommend that others avoid it, it has negative brand equity.</p>

<p>Brand Extension</p>

<p>The Brand Extension is the marketing strategy wherein a new product is launched under the existing brand name. The category in which product is launched may be related or unrelated to the brand&rsquo;s current category. The brand that gives rise to a new product under its name is called &ldquo;The Parent Brand&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Brand Identity</p>

<p>Brand identity stems from an organization, i.e., an organization is responsible for creating a distinguished product with unique characteristics. It is how an organization seeks to identify itself. It represents how an organization wants to be perceived in the market. An organization communicates its identity to the consumers through its branding and marketing strategies. A brand is unique due to its identity. Brand identity includes following elements &ndash; Brand vision, brand culture, positioning, personality, relationships, and presentations.</p>

<p>Brand Loyalty</p>

<p>Businesses plan different creative marketing strategies like reward and loyalty programs, incentives, trials and brand ambassadors to create brand loyalty. Those who are loyal to a particular brand do not purchase a substitute brand in case the preferred brand is unavailable. Loyal customers search multiple stores for their preferred brands are more likely to forego their purchase in case the brand is not available. This buying decision can be either conscious or unconscious, however, it is based upon trust that the brand fulfils the consumers. Brand loyalty is based upon emotional involvement which is created between the brand and the consumer. It is perceived by the customer that the brand will fulfill some type of emotional want or physical need in a unique way and which evokes emotions during the process of purchasing and using it.</p>

<p>Bridge Loan</p>

<p>Also called a &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; or &ldquo;gap financing,&rdquo; bridge loans are a lifeline for home buyers who are eager to purchase new digs before they&rsquo;ve sold the home they&rsquo;re currently in. In such scenarios, unless you&rsquo;ve got substantial income and wads of cash for the down payment, it can be hard to qualify for the loan amount of that new home while you are still saddled with monthly payments on the mortgage loan on your current home&mdash;for many people, that means stretching their finances awfully thin. While some lenders may be reluctant to grant borrowers a loan for that new home, lenders also know that the odds are good that the borrower will sell his old house soon enough&mdash;and then be flush. A short-term bridge loan helps span that gap.</p>

<p>Brownfield Investment</p>

<p>A Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a cross-border investment. In FDI, an investor- an individual or a firm- invests in a business opportunity in some country other than his own. The investor can invest by means of a merger, acquisition, or building a new business from scratch. Brownfield Investment is a type of FDI. In this case, an investor invests in an already existing facility instead of creating an all-together new set-up. This helps in saving precious time and a lot of money. Also, it helps in the efficient utilization of already deployed resources in the business. The investor can either make an outright purchase or lease an already running facility. Also, he can work with an existing organization by means of a merger. Moreover, the investor can become a partner or buy out a partial stake in the existing running business. There is mostly no fresh need of taking regulatory approvals from the authorities as the plant was already operational one. Such investments are most popular in cases where the planned new activity is similar to the activity that was being performed earlier. &ldquo;Brownfield&rdquo; as a terminology means that an activity is already being performed on the land even before the new investment has taken place. Hence, it is not green and there is no vegetation cover on it, as can possibly happen in the case of a Greenfield investment. Moreover, the term applies to all sorts of investment activity, whether it is cross-border or domestic investments.</p>

<p>Bubble</p>

<p>An economic bubble is a condition caused when an asset rises in value based on investor sentiment that is not supported by fundamental or technical analysis of the stock. Another way to say this is that an economic bubble is present when an asset far exceeds its intrinsic value by any conventional measure. The premise of a bubble is that investors are buying an asset for the purpose of selling it to another investor for a higher price. As long as there are buyers, the bubble can keep getting bigger. The end of a bubble occurs when buyers stop buying and the asset price sharply corrects. #C</p>

<p>Callable Bond</p>

<p>Bonds are essentially fixed-income instruments. If securities are to be classified, two broad types emerge &ndash; equity and fixed-income instruments. With the latter, investors earn income at fixed, stipulated intervals. Thus, it hedges individuals against market volatility and provides a sense of security. That is what bonds are in general. Per callable bond meaning, however, there&rsquo;s less security for the investor. These bonds come embedded with a call option. That means the issuer enjoys the right to redeem the bonds before the maturity period. While other attributes of a callable bond are similar to any other fixed-income instrument, the call option is where it differs. Organisations usually issue these bonds when there&rsquo;s a sign of interest rates moving downwards in the future. Thereby, when market interest rates actually dip, they can redeem such bonds and issue fresh ones in lieu at a lower coupon rate. To make such a financing option attractive for investors, issuing bodies typically offer a higher interest rate than what is prevalent in the market. Or else, an issuer might promise redemption at a rate higher than the face value of such bond.</p>

<p>Cancelled Cheque</p>

<p>A cancelled check is a check that has been paid by the bank. After the money is deducted from your checking account, the bank will &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; the check, so it can no longer be used. Back in the old days before modern computer systems, bank actually mailed cancelled checks back to you every month with your bank statement. Now banks don&rsquo;t do that because of the shipping and processing costs. Instead, banks usually print copies of the canceled checks on the back of each bank statement.</p>

<p>Candlestick</p>

<p>A candlestick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis that displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a specific period. It originated from Japanese rice merchants and traders to track market prices and daily momentum hundreds of years before becoming popularized in the United States. The wide part of the candlestick is called the &ldquo;real body&rdquo; and tells investors whether the closing price was higher or lower than the opening price (black/red if the stock closed lower, white/green if the stock closed higher).</p>

<p>Capacity Utilisation Rate</p>

<p>The capacity utilization rate is the percentage of potential economic output that is achieved compared to the actual output beyond which the average cost of production increases. Capacity utilization rate is used to assess a company&rsquo;s operational efficiency and is also used in a broader perspective to measure the realized potential output. This is important because it shows the company how much they can still utilize.</p>

<p>CAPE Ratio</p>

<p>The cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio of a stock market is one of the standard metrics used to evaluate whether a market is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly-valued. This metric was developed by Robert Shiller and popularized during the Dotcom Bubble when he argued (correctly) that equities were highly overvalued. For that reason, it&rsquo;s also casually referred to as the &ldquo;Shiller PE&rdquo;, meaning the Shiller variant of the typical price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of stock. It&rsquo;s most commonly applied to the S&amp;P 500, but can be and is applied to any stock index. The main benefit is that it is one of several broad valuation metrics that can help you determine how much of your portfolio should reasonably be invested into equities based on the current relationship between the price you pay for them and the value you get in return in the form of earnings. When the CAPE ratio is high, and other valuation methods are high, it&rsquo;s usually not a bad idea to trim your equity exposure or invest elsewhere where markets are cheaper.</p>

<p>Capital Account</p>

<p>Capital account can be regarded as one of the primary components of the balance of payments of a nation. It gives a summary of the capital expenditure and income for a country. A capital account deficit shows that more money is flowing out of the economy along with increase in its ownership of foreign assets and vice-versa in case of a surplus. The balance of payments contains the current account (which provides a summary of the trade of goods and services) in addition to the capital account which records all capital transactions.</p>

<p>Capital Adequecy Ratio</p>

<p>Capital Adequacy Ratio helps in measuring the financial strength or the ability of the financial institutions in meeting its obligations using its assets and capital and it is calculated by dividing capital of the bank by its risk-weighted assets. Capital adequacy ratio is a measure to find out the proportion of banks capital, with respect to the total risk-weighted assets of the bank. The credit risk attached to the assets depends on the entity the bank is lending loans to, for example, the risk attached to a loan it is lending to the government is 0%, but the amount of loan lends to the individuals is very high in percentage.</p>

<p>Capital Asset</p>

<p>Capital Asset can be defined in two terms : &ndash;</p>

<p>For firms, a capital asset is an asset that has a useful life longer than one year and is not intended for sale during the normal course of business.</p>

<p>For individuals, capital asset typically refers to anything the individual owns for personal or investment purposes. This excludes property held for sale in the normal course of business, money received or about to be received from the sale of that property, depreciable personal property used for business (such as rental property), protected creative works (such as copyrights on a book), and government publications purchased or received for free from the government.</p>

<p>Capital Budgeting</p>

<p>Capital budgeting is a method of analyzing and comparing substantial future investments and expenditures to determine which ones are most worthwhile. In other words, it&rsquo;s a process that company management uses to identify what capital projects will create the biggest return compared with the funds invested in the project. Each project is ranked by its potential future return, so the company management can choose which one to invest in first. Most business&rsquo; future goals include expanding their operations. This is difficult to do if the company doesn&rsquo;t have enough capital or fixed assets. That is where capital budgeting comes into play. Capital budgets or capital expenditure budgets are a way for a company&rsquo;s management to plan fixed asset sales and purchases. Usually these budgets help management analyze different long-term strategies that the company can take to achieve its expansion goals. In other words, the management can decide what assets it might need to sell or buy in order to expand the company. To make this decision, management typically uses these three main analyzes in the budgeting process: throughput analysis, discounted cash flows analysis, and payback analysis.</p>

<p>Capital Expenditure (CapEx)</p>

<p>A management has taken number of decisions with regard to short term investment and long term investment. Whatever be and form of investment, the profitability of the company should be increased or at least maintained. In the case of long term investment, huge amount is necessary. Such an amount is used for acquiring fixed assets i.e. plant and machinery, land and building, introducing new products, starting of one more unit, expansion, improvement or alteration of existing fixed assets, replacement of existing fixed assets, research and development and the like. The management is going to take a decision for this purpose i.e. capital expenditure decision.</p>

<p>Caviot Emptor</p>

<p>Caveat emptor is a Latin term that means &ldquo;let the buyer beware.&rdquo; Similar to the phrase &ldquo;sold as is,&rdquo; this term means that the buyer assumes the risk that a product may fail to meet expectations or have defects. In other words, the principle of caveat emptor serves as a warning that buyers have no recourse with the seller if the product does not meet their expectations. The term is actually part of a longer statement: Caveat emptor, quia ignorare non debuit quod jus alienum emit (&ldquo;Let a purchaser beware, for he ought not to be ignorant of the nature of the property which he is buying from another party.&rdquo;) The assumption is that buyers will inspect and otherwise ensure that they are confident with the integrity of the product (or land, to which it often refers) before completing a transaction. This does not, however, give sellers the green light to actively engage in fraudulent transactions.</p>

<p>Churn Rate</p>

<p>Churn rate is a measurement of the number of items or individuals moving out of a collective group during a given period of time. In marketing, the churn rate is the number (typically a percentage) of customers or subscribers who cancel or do not renew their subscription during a given period of time. A high churn rate, also referred to as customer churn, could negatively affect a business&rsquo;s profits and impede growth. Knowing the churn rate of a business is critical to evaluating the effectiveness of marketing efforts and overall customer satisfaction. In addition, it&rsquo;s much easier and cheaper to keep existing customers than acquire new ones.</p>

<p>Circular Flow Model</p>

<p>A Circular flow model of the economy is a graphical representation of the movement of money between three sectors &ndash; businesses, households, and the government &ndash; and three markets &ndash; production factors, products, and the financial market.</p>

<p>Closed Economy</p>

<p>A closed economy is a type of economy where the import and export of goods and services don&rsquo;t happen, which implies that the economy is self-sufficient and has no trading activity from outside economics. The sole purpose of such an economy is to meet all the domestic consumers&rsquo; needs within the country&rsquo;s border. In practice, there are no countries with closed economies at present. Brazil has the closest to the closed economy. It has the least import of goods compared to the countries from the rest of the world. It is impossible to meet all the goods and service demands within the domestic boundary. With globalization and technology dependency building and maintaining such economies can be a herculean task. It can be considered that India was a closed economy till 1991 and so were the other countries across the globe. At present, it is not quite possible to run a closed economy.The need for raw materials is important and plays a vital role in the final product, this makes the closed economy inefficient. The government can shut down any particular sector from the international competition through the use of quotas, subsidies, tariffs, and making it illegal in the country. They have no or limited economic relationship with other economies.</p>

That is, if the borrower defaults on their loan payments, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it to recoup some or all of its losses.</p>

<p>Collateralized Debt Obligation</p>

<p>A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) is a synthetic investment product that represents different loans bundled together and sold by the lender in the market. The holder of the collateralized debt obligation can, in theory, collect the borrowed amount from the original borrower at the end of the loan period. A collateralized debt obligation is a type of derivative security because its price (at least notionally) depends on the price of some other asset.</p>

<p>Collateralized Loan Obligation</p>

<p>Collateralized loan obligations (CLO) are securities that are backed by a pool of loans. In other words, CLOs are repackaged loans that are sold to investors. They are similar to a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), except that the underlying instruments are loans instead of mortgage.</p>

<p>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations</p>

<p>Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO) is a type of mortgage-backed investment wherein a number of mortgages are pooled in together and sold as investment securities. Cash inflow occurs when the borrowers repay their loans which are then paid out to the CMO investors.</p>

<p>Combined Ratio</p>

<p>The combined ratio, which is generally used in the insurance sector (especially in property and casualty sectors), is the measure of profitability to understand how an insurance company is performing in its daily operations and is by the addition of two ratios i.e., underwriting loss ratio and expense ratio.</p>

A common example is a workplace retirement fund.</p>

<p>Commodity</p>

<p>A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers.</p>

<p>Consignment</p>

<p>Consignment is a business arrangement in which a business, also referred to as a consignee, agrees to pay a seller, or consignor, for merchandise after the item sells.

<p>Contribution Margin</p>

<p>The contribution margin is the amount of money a business has to cover its fixed costs and contribute to net profit or loss after paying variable costs. It also measures whether a product is generating enough revenue to pay for fixed costs and determines the profit it is generating. The contribution margin can be calculated in dollars, units, or as a percentage. Additionally, the contribution margin is used to determine the break-even point, which is the number of units produced or revenues generated to break even. It also lets you know how much a particular product is contributing to your overall business profit.</p>

<p>Contributed Capital</p>

<p>Contributed Capital is the amount that the shareholders have given to the company for buying their stake and is recorded in the books of accounts as the common stock and additional paid-in capital under the equity section of the company&rsquo;s balance sheet.

<p>The contribution margin is the amount of money a business has to cover its fixed costs and contribute to net profit or loss after paying variable costs. It also measures whether a product is generating enough revenue to pay for fixed costs and determines the profit it is generating. The contribution margin can be calculated in dollars, units, or as a percentage. Additionally, the contribution margin is used to determine the break-even point, which is the number of units produced or revenues generated to break even. It also lets you know how much a particular product is contributing to your overall business profit.</p>

<p>Convexity</p>

<p>Convexity is a price-predicting tool for bonds. It also reveals the interest rate risk of a bond and helps investors consider whether a bond&rsquo;s yield is worth the underlying risk. Most mortgage bonds are negatively convex, largely because they can be prepaid. An issuer&rsquo;s incentive to call a callable bond at par also increases as interest rates decrease; therefore, the prices of instruments with negative convexity do not rise as quickly as the prices of noncallable bonds, whose convexity is different.</p>

<p>Cook the Book</p>

<p>Cooks the book is used to describe that the fraudulent activities performed by the corporations for falsifying their financial statements and therefore, as a means to distort financial accounts of the firm deliberately for avoiding the tax payments or hiding of the facts so that the situation of the company seems better than the actual situation prevailing.</p>

<p>The dictionary defines copyright as &ldquo;a person&rsquo;s exclusive right to reproduce, publish, or sell his or her original work of authorship (as a literary, musical, dramatic, artistic, or architectural work).&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important to understand that copyright law covers the &ldquo;form of material expression,&rdquo; not the actual concepts, ideas, techniques, or facts in a particular work. This is the reason behind why a work must be fixed in a tangible form in order to receive copyright protection. A couple examples of works being fixed in a tangible form include stories written on paper and original paintings on canvas.</p>

<p>Core Competencies</p>

<p>Core competencies are the defining capabilities or advantages that a business may have that distinguish it from the competition. Core competence is the foundation for sharpening a company&rsquo;s competitive edge, and it guides brand reputation, business growth, and marketing strategy.</p>

<p>Corporate Bond</p>

<p>&ldquo;Companies issue bonds to raise cash to bolster their balance sheets or re-invest in a particular project or expansion plan, &rdquo; says Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdow. &ldquo;Investors who buy corporate bonds are lending money to the company, in the same way as investors who buy government bonds like US Treasuries or UK Gilts are lending money to governments to finance public spending.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corporate Citizenship</p>

<p>Corporate citizenship involves the social responsibility of businesses and the extent to which they meet legal, ethical, and economic responsibilities, as established by shareholders.

Often, corporate culture is implied, not expressly defined, and develops organically over time from the cumulative traits of the people the company hires.</p>

<p>Corporate Structure</p>

<p>Corporate structure refers to the organization of different departments or business units within a company. Depending on a company&rsquo;s goals and the industry in which it operates, corporate structure can differ significantly between companies. Each of the departments usually performs a specialized function while constantly collaborating with each other to achieve corporate goals and values.</p>

<p>Cost Benefit Analysis</p>

<p>The cost-benefit analysis is largely employed when estimating the cost of a transaction compared to the benefits derived, seeking to determine the optimum approach to achieve benefits. When it comes to monetary decisions, the cost-benefit analysis estimates the monetary value of the costs, and the monetary value of the benefits, and compares them to evaluate whether the decision is worth taking. To be comparable, though, all aspects of a project should be expressed in the same unit, most likely money.</p>

<p>Cost Control</p>

<p>Cost Control is one of the most efficient tools that businesses use to decrease the production cost. In this, important details are provided to the management, so they can know that actual costs and predetermined costs are aligned.</p>

<p>Cost Of Debt</p>

<p>Cost of debt is the expected rate of return for the debt holder and is usually calculated as the effective interest rate applicable to a firms liability. It is an integral part of the discounted valuation analysis, which calculates the present value of a firm by discounting future cash flows by the expected rate of return to its equity and debt holders.</p>

<p>Cost Of Equity</p>

<p>The cost of equity is the return that investors expect from a security as reimbursement for the risk they undertake by investing in the particular security. In other words, it&rsquo;s the amount of return that investors require before they start looking for better investments that will pay more.</p>

<p>Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS)</p>

<p>Businesses need to track all of the costs that are directly and indirectly involved in producing their products for sale. These costs are called the cost of goods sold (COGS), and this calculation appears in the company&rsquo;s profit and loss statement (P&amp;L). It&rsquo;s also an important part of the information the company must report on its tax return.</p>

<p>Cost Of Labour</p>

<p>The cost of labor is the sum of all wages paid to employees, as well as the cost of employee benefits and payroll taxes paid by an employer.

Direct costs include wages for the employees that produce a product, including workers on an assembly line, while indirect costs are associated with support labor, such as employees who maintain factory equipment.</p>

<p>Cost Of Living</p>

<p>The definition of the cost of living is the average cost of all basic necessities including food, housing, utilities, transportation, clothing and health care expenses.</p>

<p>Cost Of Living Adjustment</p>

<p>The cost of living adjustment (COLA) is an increase in income that keeps up with the cost of living. It&rsquo;s often applied to wages, salaries, and benefits. These include union agreements, executive contracts, and retiree benefits.</p>

<p>Cost Of Revenue</p>

<p>Cost of Revenues refers to the directly attributable to the goods or services of a company and includes the manufacturing, production and distribution cost of a product or service to its customers.</p>

<p>Cost Per Click</p>

<p>The terms pay-per-click (PPC) and cost-per-click (CPC) are sometimes used interchangeably, sometimes as distinct terms. When used as distinct terms, PPC indicates payment based on click-throughs, while CPC indicates measurement of cost on a per-click basis for contracts not based on click-throughs.</p>

<p>Credit Analyst</p>

<p>Credit analysis is a very particular area revolving around a firm&rsquo;s financial risk analysis. The procedure involves evaluating the risks that businesses involved in loan financing are likely to experience by initiating background research on the retail or commercial customer. In other words, a financier must perform due diligence on rating the credit of the borrower.</p>

<p>Creditworthiness</p>

<p>The creditworthiness is a measure of how well you&rsquo;ve handled your credit and debt obligations. Creditors can tell how you&rsquo;ve managed borrowing money by looking at your credit report, which is a record of the activity on your credit accounts. Your credit score is based on the information in your credit report.</p>

<p>Cross Culture</p>

<p>Cross culture in the business world refers to a company&rsquo;s efforts to ensure that its people interact effectively with professionals from backgrounds different from their own. Like the adjective cross-cultural, it implies a recognition of national, regional, and ethnic differences in manners and methods and a desire to bridge them.</p>

<p>Crowdfunding</p>

<p>Crowdfunding combines the concepts of crowdsourcing and microfinancing, bringing together various individuals who commit small amounts of money to projects and entities they want to support. This is often done through websites that make it easy for entities to find potential funders. Funders could expect something in return for their contributions&mdash;such as equity, products, or services&mdash;or they may donate the funds.</p>

<p>Crowding Out Effect</p>

<p>The crowding-out effect refers to an economic theory that states that the rising interest rates decrease the initial private total investment spending. Note that an increase in interest rates impact the investment decision by investors. When the crowding of effect becomes significantly high, it may lead to reduced income in the economy. This happens because when there is increased public sector spending, there is usually decreased spending in the private sector.</p>

<p>Cylical Stocks</p>

<p>A cyclical stock is one that will rise and fall with the economy. When the economy is strong, unemployment is low, and both production and consumer spending is high, cyclical stocks tend to gain in value. But when a weakening economy hits &ndash; causing businesses to contract and lay workers off, and people to shut their wallets &ndash; the value of these stocks goes down. #D</p>

<p>Darvas Box Theory</p>

<p>The Darvas Box Theory was a trading strategy that was invented by self-taught investor Nicolas Darvas, who used to target stocks with pricing and volume as indicators. It makes the Darvas Box Theory similar to technical analysis, which is a trading discipline that is applied by security traders who observe patterns within historical trading data and attempt to analyze securities with the underlying trading data.</p>

<p>A day order is defined as an instruction from a trader to their broker, to buy or sell a certain asset. Setting a day order means that the deal has to be executed if an asset hits a specified price (referred to as the level) at any point during the trading day on which the order is made.</p>

<p>Days Payable Outstanding</p>

<p>The days payable outstanding (DPO) is a financial ratio that calculates the average time it takes a company to pay its bills and invoices to other company and vendors by comparing accounts payable, cost of sales, and number of days bills remain unpaid.</p>

<p>Decoupling</p>

<p>Decoupling represents the creation of gaps. In finance, decoupling happens when different asset classes or markets that typically demonstrate positive correlations start to move in opposite directions. In organizational studies, decoupling takes place when there are gaps between formal policies and actual practices in an organization. Eco-economic decoupling considers the environmental impacts of economic growth. It refers to economic growth without leading to greater environmental pressure.</p>

<p>Deed of Reconveyance</p>

<p>A deed of reconveyance refers to a document that transfers the title of a property to the trustor from the trustee once a mortgage is paid off. The trustor is the borrower of debt for the purchase of the property. The trustee may be a bank or mortgage holder. A deed of reconveyance is important to understand for those looking to take out a mortgage to purchase a property. The document indicates that the borrower is now the sole owner of the property, and it confirms that the mortgage loan has been paid in full.</p>

<p>Default Risk</p>

<p>Default risk is the type of risk that measures the chances of not fulfilling the obligations such as non-repayment of principal or interest and is mathematically calculated based on the past commitments, financial conditions, market conditions, liquidity position and present obligations, etc. Many factors affect default like heavy losses suffered, blockage of money in long term assets, poor cash flow and financial position, economic conditions like recession, etc. It is measured by the ratings issued by the credit rating agencies.</p>

<p>Defensive Stock</p>

<p>Defensive stocks reflect companies whose earnings growth and performance have a low correlation to the economy. Revenue, profit and cash flow for companies whose stocks are considered to be defensive will remain stable regardless of the economy, as will the share price of the stock.</p>

<p>Deferment Period</p>

<p>A deferment period is a length of time where the borrower does not need to pay interest or repay the remaining amount on a loan. Before the loan is issued, a contractual agreement is decided between the lender and the borrower regarding the length of the deferment period.</p>

<p>Deferred Annuity</p>

<p>When you purchase an annuity, if you decide to start receiving payments within a year, you have an immediate annuity. Should you decide to wait to collect or at some point in the future, you have a deferred annuity. Deferred annuities allow your principal to increase before you begin to receive the stream of payments. Typically, annuities, such as qualified longevity annuity contracts, are bought for future retirement income.</p>

<p>Deferred Income Tax</p>

<p>Deferred income tax is a balance sheet item which can either be a liability or an asset as it is a difference resulting from recognition of income between the accounting records of the company and the tax law because of which the income tax payable by the company is not equal to the total expense of tax reported.</p>

<p>Deferred Interest</p>

<p>Deferred interest is when a credit card or loan offers a period during which interest accrues, but it&rsquo;s not charged. You must have the balance paid by the end of the period; otherwise, you may be charged all of the accrued interest owed from the date you originally made your purchase. In other words, you could be hit with a large bill.</p>

<p>Deferred Profit Sharing Plan</p>

<p>A Deferred Profit Sharing Plan (DPSP) is a compensation plan wherein employers share a part of their profits with employees. Under the DPSP scheme, employees are entitled to get a share of the profits of the company. However, the amount thus received is not immediately given to the beneficiary. It is first put into a deposit account, where it is allowed to grow without being subject to taxes. Generally, beneficiaries are allowed to decide how they want the money to be invested.</p>

<p>Deferred Revenue</p>

<p>Deferred revenue refers to payments customers give you before you provide them with a good or service. The payment is not yet revenue because you haven&rsquo;t earned it. Deferred revenue is common in businesses where customers pay a retainer to guarantee services or prepay for a subscription. Deferred revenue is sometimes called unearned revenue, deferred income, or unearned income.</p>

<p>Deferred Tax Asset</p>

<p>A deferred tax asset is an income tax created by a carrying amount of net loss or tax credit, which is eventually returned to the company and reported on the company&rsquo;s balance sheet as an asset. Companies use tax deferrals to lower the income tax expenses of the coming accounting period, provided that next tax period will generate positive earnings.</p>

<p>Deleveraging</p>

<p>Deleveraging is defined as the process where an organization slashes down its debt or financial leverage by either selling its own assets or raising equity capital. The prime goal of deleveraging is to curtail the proportionate percentage of the balance sheet of a business that is funded by its liabilities.</p>

<p>Dematerialization</p>

<p>Demonetization is an economic process in which a country&rsquo;s currency unit is no longer legal tender. A currency unit is what we would commonly refer to as physical money, such as banknotes and coins. When demonetization occurs, the country&rsquo;s currency unit is essentially worthless, as it can no longer be used to purchase goods and services.</p>

<p>Denomination</p>

<p>A denomination is a classification for the face value of a financial instrument. It includes financial instruments, such as bonds, currency notes, coins, etc. In particular, the denomination is a classification used to clarify acceptable payment options in financial trades.</p>

<p>Dependency Ratio</p>

<p>The dependency ratio compares the number of dependent individuals by age to the total population. Specifically, it measures people between the ages of 0 to 14 and above 65 to those who are 15 to 64. By doing so, it shows who is and is not working, which thereby signals how unemployment causes economic burden.</p>

<p>Depository Receipts</p>

<p>Depositary receipts allow investors to invest in companies in foreign countries while trading in a local stock exchange in the investor&rsquo;s home country. It is advantageous to investors since shares are not allowed to leave the home country that they trade in.</p>

<p>Depository Transfer Check</p>

<p>A depository transfer check (DTC), also known as a depository transfer draft, is used when a third-party service provider collects daily receipts from an organization&rsquo;s locations and deposits it at a concentration bank. Since an organization may expand its business and operate in several locations, it is convenient to use a depository transfer check in order to ensure better cash management for all its locations.</p>

<p>Depository Trust and clearing Corporation</p>

<p>The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a US-based corporation that acts as a centralized clearing and settlement company for different asset classes.

Also called an industrialized country, a developed economy is measured by a country&rsquo;s gross domestic product, which typically is well diversified.</p>

<p>Development Economics</p>

<p>Development economics is a branch of economics that deals with the improvement of the economies of developing countries. The discipline aims at establishing strategies that apply to different developing countries depending on their unique social, political, and economic factors. Development economics also explores the unique challenges that face developing nations thus helps in the analysis of the opportunities available in these nations and how they can be applied. Development economics makes use of economic theory, econometric methods, political science, and demographics in its approaches.</p>

<p>Digital Currency</p>

<p>Digital currency is a payment method which exists only in electronic form and is not tangible. Digital currency can be transferred between entities or users with the help of technology like computers, smartphones and the internet.

<p>Earnest Money</p>

<p>Earnest money is a deposit a buyer gives to a seller showing they want to buy the home and will hold up to their end of the purchase agreement. The initial home offer will specify the amount and terms. Earnest money may be deemed non-refundable after a set period of time, called an option period, unless the seller and buyer agree on conditions in which the deposit would be returned. The funds are held in an escrow or trust account until closing, where the funds are used towards the home&rsquo;s purchase price. It is not to be confused with a down payment or closing costs.</p>

<p>Economic Growth</p>

<p>Economic growth is an increase in the production of goods and services over a specific period. To be most accurate, the measurement must remove the effects of inflation. Economic growth creates more profit for businesses. As a result, stock prices rise. That gives companies capital to invest and hire more employees. As more jobs are created, incomes rise. Consumers have more money to buy additional products and services. Purchases drive higher economic growth. For this reason, all countries want positive economic growth. This makes economic growth the most-watched economic indicator.</p>

<p>Economic Moat</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;economic moat&rdquo; refers to a long-term competitive advantage that a company holds that protects its position in the marketplace. The term is inspired by the moat that surrounded medieval castles to protect the valuables within from invaders. A company with a strong moat possesses a competitive advantage that is both strong and sustainable. Investors such as Warren Buffet state that buying businesses is like buying castles. Buffett emphasizes the importance of buying businesses with deep moats, as they are protected from competitors and can, therefore, maintain strong profits.</p>

<p>Endowment Fund</p>

<p>An endowment fund is a financial asset, typically held by a non-profit organization, which contains the capital investments and related earnings leveraged by the non-profit organization to fund the overall mission.</p>

<p>Enterprise Resource Planning</p>

<p>Feasibility Study</p>

<p>A feasibility study, as the name suggests, is designed to reveal whether a project/plan is feasible. It is an assessment of the practicality of a proposed project/plan. A feasibility study is part of the initial design stage of any project/plan. It is conducted in order to objectively uncover the strengths and weaknesses of a proposed project or an existing business. It can help to identify and assess the opportunities and threats present in the natural environment, the resources required for the project, and the prospects for success.</p>

<p>Fiat Money</p>

<p>Fiat Money is the currency which is declared as the legal tender by the government and has no backing of the physical commodity like gold and rather the value of the fiat money is derived from the demand-supply relationship in the market. The India Rupee and US Dollar are the fiat currencies of India and America, respectively. The face value of fiat currencies is far high than their commodity values. Most of the modern paper currencies of the world are fiat currencies.</p>

<p>General Agreement Tariffs and Trades</p>

<p>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), set of multilateral trade agreements aimed at the abolition of quotas and the reduction of tariff duties among the contracting nations. When GATT was concluded by 23 countries at Geneva, in 1947 (to take effect on Jan. 1, 1948), it was considered an interim arrangement pending the formation of a United Nations agency to supersede it. When such an agency failed to emerge, GATT was amplified and further enlarged at several succeeding negotiations. It subsequently proved to be the most effective instrument of world trade liberalization, playing a major role in the massive expansion of world trade in the second half of the 20th century. By the time GATT was replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, 125 nations were signatories to its agreements, which had become a code of conduct governing 90 percent of world trade.</p>

<p>Giffen Goods</p>

<p>Giffen goods are those, whose demand curve doesn&rsquo;t conform to &ldquo;the first rule of demand&rdquo;, i.e. price and quantity demanded of Giffen goods are inversely related to each other, unlike other goods, where price and quantity demanded are positively related. They are inferior goods without a substitute. These are named after the Scottish statistician, Sir Robert Giffen.</p>

<p>Globalization</p>

<p>Globalization means the interconnection of national economies across the world on issues such as trade, investment, labor, banking and the movement of people, goods and services. That seems like a mouthful, but it basically boils down to governments increasingly allowing their citizens do business across borders.</p>

<p>Goods and Services Tax</p>

<p>As the name suggests, GST is levied on the sale of goods and services in the country. Unlike previous indirect taxes, this tax is collected at the point of consumption and not at the point of origin. To summarise, GST is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax which is levied on every value addition. The law governing GST was passed in the parliament on the 29th of March 2017 and it was implemented across the country on the 1st of July 2017.</p>

<p>Gordon Growth Model</p>

<p>The Gordon growth model (GGM) helps investors calculate the intrinsic value of a stock based upon future dividends that grow at a steady pace. It gets its name from Professor Myron Gordon of the University of Toronto, who originally published it in 1956. The GGM is a popular valuation method and the most widely used of the dividend discount models (DDMs) for valuation. It assumes that a company&rsquo;s dividend grows at a steady rate in perpetuity, giving investors a present value of the company based on that future series of payments. The model works best on companies with stable dividend growth rates, such as Dividend Aristocrats.</p>

<p>Great Depression</p>

<p>Great Depression, worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted until about 1939. It was the longest and most severe depression ever experienced by the industrialized Western world, sparking fundamental changes in economic institutions, macroeconomic policy, and economic theory. Although it originated in the United States, the Great Depression caused drastic declines in output, severe unemployment, and acute deflation in almost every country of the world. Its social and cultural effects were no less staggering, especially in the United States, where the Great Depression represented the harshest adversity faced by Americans since the Civil War.</p>

<p>Gross National Product</p>

<p>Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all goods and services made by a country&rsquo;s residents and businesses, regardless of production location. GNP counts the investments made by U.S. residents and businesses&mdash;both inside and outside the country&mdash;and computes the value of all products manufactured by domestic companies, regardless of where they are made. #H</p>

<p>Hedge</p>

<p>A hedge is an investment that protects your finances from a risky situation. Hedging is done to minimize or offset the chance that your assets will lose value. It also limits your loss to a known amount if the asset does lose value. It&rsquo;s similar to home insurance. You pay a fixed amount each month. If a fire wipes out all the value of your home, your loss is the only the known amount of the deductible.</p>

<p>Heteroskedasticity</p>

<p>Heteroskedasticity refers to situations where the variance of the residuals is unequal over a range of measured values. When running a regression analysis, heteroskedasticity results in an unequal scatter of the residuals (also known as the error term). When observing a plot of the residuals, a fan or cone shape indicates the presence of heteroskedasticity. In statistics, heteroskedasticity is seen as a problem because regressions involving ordinary least squares (OLS) assume that the residuals are drawn from a population with constant variance. If there is an unequal scatter of residuals, the population used in the regression contains unequal variance, and therefore the results are inaccurate.</p>

<p>Holding Company</p>

<p>A holding company is a company that doesn&rsquo;t conduct any operations, ventures, or other active tasks for itself. Instead, it exists for the purpose of owning assets. In other words, the company does not engage in the buying and selling of any products and services. Instead, it was formed so that it gains control over one or more companies.</p>

<p>Homestead Exemption</p>

<p>A homestead exemption is a legal mandate that shields a homeowner from the loss of his or her home, usually due to the death of a home-owning spouse, a debilitating illness or if the homeowner slides into bankruptcy. The age of the homeowner may also come into play, as well. A homestead exemption can also protect a homeowner in distress from onerous property taxes, with built-in mechanisms that either reduce those taxes or remove them altogether.</p>

<p>Hurdle Rate</p>

<p>The hurdle rate is the minimum return that a business needs before it will launch a project or other form of investment. This is otherwise known as the target rate, the required rate of return or the minimum acceptable rate of return. A company uses the hurdle rate to decide whether to make an investment, such as launching a new project or buying a security. Before a company moves forward with an investment it must expect a rate of return that matches or exceeds the hurdle rate. An investment that returns below the hurdle is typically considered either too risky to justify or, in some cases, unprofitable compared to other alternatives. #I</p>

<p>Inferior Goods</p>

<p>An inferior good is a product that&rsquo;s demand is inversely related to consumer income. In other words, when consumer income increases, the demand for inferior goods decreases.</p>

<p>Inflation</p>

<p>Inflation is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time. A quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy over some period of time. The rise in the general level of prices, often expressed a a percentage means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods.</p>

<p>Interpersonal Skills</p>

<p>Interpersonal skills are the skills required to effectively communicate, interact, and work with individuals and groups. Those with good interpersonal skills are strong verbal and non-verbal communicators and are often considered to be &ldquo;good with people&rdquo;. Whether they&rsquo;re used in your career or personal life, these skills are important for success.</p>

<p>Inventory Turnover</p>

<p>The inventory turnover ratio is a formula that makes it easy to figure out how long it takes for a business to sell through its entire inventory. A higher inventory turnover ratio usually indicates that a business has strong sales compared to a company with a lower inventory turnover ratio.</p>

<p>Invisible Hand</p>

<p>Invisible hand, metaphor, introduced by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith, that characterizes the mechanisms through which beneficial social and economic outcomes may arise from the accumulated self-interested actions of individuals, none of whom intends to bring about such outcomes. The notion of the invisible hand has been employed in economics and other social sciences to explain the division of labour, the emergence of a medium of exchange, the growth of wealth, the patterns (such as price levels) manifest in market competition, and the institutions and rules of society. More controversially, it has been used to argue that free markets, made up of economic agents who act in their own self-interest, deliver the best possible social and economic outcomes. #J</p>

<p>January Effect</p>

<p>The January Effect is a theory which says that every December stock prices take a dip and every January they receive a boost. This is driven by heavy selling during December and aggressive buying during January, particularly early in the month. Investors tend to sell off low-performing stocks at the end of each year. They then tend to buy those stocks back a few weeks or even days later.</p>

<p>Jensen&rsquo;s Measures</p>

<p>Jensen&rsquo;s measure is a statistical measurement of the portion of a security&rsquo;s or portfolio&rsquo;s return that is not explained by the market or the security&rsquo;s relationship to the market but rather by the skill of the investor or portfolio manager. It is also called alpha.</p>

<p>Joint and Several Liability</p>

<p>The theory of joint and several liability applies when multiple parties are collectively liable for a person&rsquo;s injuries or damages. The initiating party in a lawsuit, referred to as the plaintiff, can seek compensation from one or more defendants separately, or from all of them as a group when they have joint and several liability. The term effectively translates to &ldquo;together or separately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joint Tenancy</p>

<p>Joint tenancy is a co-ownership arrangement in which two or more individuals hold a title to a specific property. While joint tenancy can apply to personal property, bank and brokerage accounts and business ownership, it&rsquo;s most commonly used for investments in real estate.</p>

<p>A joint venture (JV) is a business arrangement in which two or more parties agree to pool their resources for the purpose of accomplishing a specific task. This task can be a new project or any other business activity. #K</p>

<p>Key Performance Indicators</p>

<p>A Key Performance Indicator is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives. Organizations use KPIs at multiple levels to evaluate their success at reaching targets. High-level KPIs may focus on the overall performance of the business, while low-level KPIs may focus on processes in departments such as sales, marketing, HR, support and others.</p>

<p>Key Rate Duration</p>

<p>The key rate duration is considered a superior metric to effective duration. It is because the effective duration metric is only applicable to parallel shifts in interest rates and the yield curve &ndash; when interest rates for all the various bond maturities simultaneously increase or decrease by the same amount.</p>

<p>Keynesian Economics</p>

<p>Keynesian economics argues that the driving force of an economy is aggregate demand&mdash;the total spending for goods and services by the private sector and government. In the Keynesian economic model, total spending determines all economic outcomes, from production to employment rate. In Keynesian economics, demand is crucial&mdash;and often erratic. Keynes explained that the prosperity of whole economies could decline even if their capacity to produce was undiminished, because decline is influenced by demand.</p>

<p>Kiting</p>

<p>Kiting, also called check kiting, is a fraudulent scheme that uses checks to embezzle money from a business. Kiting is usually committed by a bookkeeper or someone else with access to company checks and the ability to forge checks, but it can also be used by the company.</p>

<p>Knowledge Economy</p>

<p>The knowledge economy is focused on the essential importance of human capital in the 21st-century economy. The rapid expansion of knowledge and the increasing reliance on computerization, big data analytics, and automation are changing the economy of the developed world to one that is more dependent on intellectual capital and skills, and less dependent on the production process. The term &ldquo;knowledge economy&rdquo; was popularized by famed business management consultant, Peter Drucker, first in his 1966 book, &ldquo;The Effective Executive,&rdquo; and then further in his 1969 book, &ldquo;The Age of Discontinuity.&rdquo; Drucker was well ahead of his time with his emphasis on knowledge/skills, data analysis and measurable performance, and strategic management by objectives (MBO).</p>

<p>Kyoto Protocol</p>

<p>The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty created by the United Nations in 1997 that aimed to reduce carbon emissions worldwide, thereby combating global warming or climate change. The name, Kyoto, was derived from the city in Japan where the protocol was adopted. The Kyoto Protocol was an extension of the UN&rsquo;s 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change. The convention initially committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It was based on the UN&rsquo;s belief that there was a consensus among the scientific community that global warming is a real phenomenon, and is primarily caused by carbon emissions made by human activities. #L</p>

<p>Law Of Demand</p>

<p>The law of demand states that other factors being constant (cetris peribus), price and quantity demand of any good and service are inversely related to each other. When the price of a product increases, the demand for the same product will fall.</p>

<p>Law Of Supply</p>

<p>Law of supply states that other factors remaining constant, price and quantity supplied of a good are directly related to each other. In other words, when the price paid by buyers for a good rises, then suppliers increase the supply of that good in the market.</p>

<p>Leadership</p>

<p>Leadership captures the essentials of being able and prepared to inspire others. Effective leadership is based upon ideas&mdash;both original and borrowed&mdash;that are effectively communicated to others in a way that engages them enough to act as the leader wants them to act.</p>

<p>Letters Of Credit</p>

<p>A letter of credit is a document from a bank or a financial institution on the buyer&rsquo;s behalf that assures the payment to the seller. The bank needs to have certain documents in possession before it issues the LC. This letter is as good as a guarantee to the seller that the payment will be cleared even if the buyer fails to do so. The risk of non-payment shifts from the seller to the bank. Generally, the entire process also involves another bank that works as an advisor to the seller. The issuing bank authorizes the advisory bank to pay the seller. The commercial LC has been used for ages to facilitate the process of payment in domestic as well as an international trade like import and export letter of credit. In fact, its usage will increase with the development of the global economy.</p>

<p>Mutual Fund</p>

<p>Mutual funds are investment strategies that allow you to pool your money together with other investors to purchase a collection of stocks, bonds, or other securities that might be difficult to recreate on your own. This is often referred to as a portfolio. The price of the mutual fund, also known as its net asset value (NAV) is determined by the total value of the securities in the portfolio, divided by the number of the fund&rsquo;s outstanding shares. This price fluctuates based on the value of the securities held by the portfolio at the end of each business day. Note that mutual fund investors do not actually own the securities in which the fund invests; they only own shares in the fund itself. #N</p>

<p>Regression</p>

<p>In statistics, a process for determining a line or curve that best represents the general trend of a data set. Linear regression results in a line of best fit, for which the sum of the squares of the vertical distances between the proposed line and the points of the data set are minimized. Other types of regression may be based on higher-degree polynomial functions or exponential functions.</p>

<p>Return on Asset</p>

<p>Return on Assets (ROA) is a type of return on investment (ROI) metric that measures the profitability of a business in relation to its total assets. This ratio indicates how well a company is performing by comparing the profit (net income) it&rsquo;s generating to the capital it&rsquo;s invested in assets. The higher the return, the more productive and efficient management is in utilizing economic resources.</p>

<p>Return on Equity</p>

<p>The sole purpose of the zeta model is to anticipate the likelihood a publicly-traded company will declare bankruptcy in the next two years. The model was developed by Edward Altman, professor at New York University, in 1960. It uses five simple factors to measure the likelihood of bankruptcy on a numeric scale. If a company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Z-score&rdquo; is below 1.8, it is likely to go bankrupt within two years. If the z-score is above 3.0, it is very unlikely to declare bankruptcy. </p>
